# SDG Analysis and VietNam's SDG Forecasting

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Vietnam’s progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
Using both international and domestic datasets, we apply hybrid models (Time Series and Machine Learning) combined with SHAP analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast Vietnam’s SDG Index Score for 2025–2030.
- Analyze factors that positively or negatively impact SDG progress.
- Provide policy recommendations to support sustainable development strategies.

## 📂 Workflow

- Data Preprocessing – merge, clean, and impute missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – descriptive statistics, correlations, and visualizations.
- Forecasting Models – build and optimize Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models (with GridSearchCV).
- SHAP Analysis – interpret model outputs and evaluate the contribution of each feature to the SDG Index.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Projections suggest Vietnam may face challenges in achieving all SDGs by 2030.
- Three factor groups were identified: drivers, barriers, and uncertain impacts.
- Strategic recommendations include: poverty reduction, improved healthcare and education, expansion of clean energy, and stronger governance transparency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, shap, matplotlib, seaborn
